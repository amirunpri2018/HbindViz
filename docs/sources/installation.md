## Installation


Visualizing H-bonds identified via Hbind is a 3-step process:

1. Generating an Hbind interaction table
2. Creating the PyMOL visualization commands via HbindViz' hbind_pymol_cmds.py Python script
3. Executing the generated PyMOL commands to visualize hydrogen-bonds in PyMOL

### Installing interaction tools

*No installation is required to run the `hbind_pymol_cmds.py` Python script, which is available in the `code` subdirectory at [https://github.com/psa-lab/HbindViz](https://github.com/psa-lab/HbindViz). ([Python 3.6](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-360/) or greater is recommended.)*

However, running the visualization script requires an installation of Hbind, which is freely available at [https://github.com/psa-lab/Hbind](https://github.com/psa-lab/Hbind). Please visit the *Installation* page at [https://psa-lab.github.io/hbind/installation](https://psa-lab.github.io/hbind/installation) for more information.
